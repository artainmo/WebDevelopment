### Introduction
Ruby is a flexible programming language often used in webdevelopment with the Ruby on Rails framework.<br>
Ruby is a high-level, object-oriented, language considered easy to use.<br>
Ruby is interpreted, meaning a compiler is not necessary. The interpreter runs the code in the console.

Ruby variables are loosely typed and can contain as data types; numbers, booleans or strings.

Arithmetic operations; +, -, *, /, **(exponentiation, fractions allow roots), %(modulo, remainder of given division).

puts and print can be used like this to print to the console `puts "hello world"`, the difference being that puts comes with a terminating /n.<br>
For string interpolation set the variable name in between #{}.
gets can be used to get input from a user, its method .chomp removes the trailing /n.<br>

Ruby consists of objects and those contain a variety of methods.<br>
For example strings contain the length method, which returns the number of characters in a string: `puts "Hello World".length` in console gives 11.<br>
Other methods on strings are reverse, upcase, downcase, capitalize(first letter uppercase only)...<br>
variable1.method! is the same as variable1 = variable1.method, through the use of '!'. 

Single-line-comments are indicated with # and multi-line-comments like this:<br>
<pre>=begin
dwdqwdwqd
dwdwq
=end</pre>
