# WebSockets-ws Chat Application

In this project a real-time chat is created using websockets.

We will use the javascript ws package to create a websocket server in server.js, the websocket server has to be created from a HTTP server.

In public/index.html (indide <script></script> allowing javascript code) we create the client websocket that uses the server websocket URL for an API call.

To run this application use node server.js
